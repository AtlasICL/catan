# Catan clone in python
**Author: Emre Acarsoy**, University of Exeter  


This personal project is a recreation in python of the board game Catan (formerly known as Settlers of Catan).  
Catan is a board game where players compete to "settle" an island. Players collect various resources and use them to build roads and villages to earn points.

This project is written in python. The module tkinter was used for the interface. No extra requirements.  

---
## Build

To build, simply run `main.py` in the `src` folder.

---

## Interface 

The 'Roll Dice' button updates the value of the two 6 sided dice in the top left.  
The small black circle is the robber. You can move the robber with your mouse, using drag and drop. Alternatively, the 'Random Bandit' button places the robber at a random location on the board.  
Below is an example of the interface:
