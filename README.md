# Catan clone in python
This personal project is a recreation in python of the board game Catan (formerly known as Settlers of Catan).  
Catan is a board game where players compete to "settle" an island. Players collect various resources and use them to build roads and villages to earn points.

The clone is written entirely in python. The module tkinter was used for the interface.  
The project does not support online multiplayer, however I am planning to add local multiplayer support.
