# Catan clone in python
This personal project is a recreation in python of the board game Catan (formerly known as Settlers of Catan).  
Catan is a board game where players compete to "settle" an island. Players collect various resources and use them to build roads and villages to earn points.

This project is written in python. The module tkinter was used for the interface.
